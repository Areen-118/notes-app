# Project Title: Note App
 
## Project Idea

The project aims to create an electronic notes application that allows users to write, save, edit, and delete their notes easily.  

It was designed to be simple, user-friendly, and have a modern instructive interface.
 
## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building and updating the user interface dynamically.  

- **Node.js**: For running JavaScript on the server side.  

- **Express.js**: For building the backend and managing API routes.  

- **MongoDB**: For securely and efficiently storing note data.
 
## How It Works

Users can add their notes through the React-based interface.  

The data is sent to the server using Express and Node.js, then stored in the MongoDB database.  

Users can view, edit, or delete their notes at any time.
 
## Result

A full-stack, efficient Notes App built using modern JavaScript technologies (MERN Stack), helping users manage their notes effectively.
